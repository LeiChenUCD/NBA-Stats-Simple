Project Proposal Group 6

Our proposed project aims to develop an interactive website dedicated to tracking various aspects of the NBA, including games, players, and teams. The primary functionality of the site will enable users to select their preferred teams or players, subsequently providing them with comprehensive statistics from previous games, and scheduling details for upcoming matches. Moreover, an individual's performance statistics will also be consistently updated and accessible.

In an endeavour to establish greater interactivity and differentiation, we aim to incorporate a distinct mini-game component - a trivia-based questionnaire, which promotes user engagement by prompting basketball-related queries such as, "Who has accumulated the most points this season?" or "Who is the tallest player?", and so forth.

We plan to utilise the 'balldontlie' API (https://www.balldontlie.io/home.html), which is used to query player and team stats, and it is available free of charge. This reliable resource will ensure we deliver an accurate and fun game to our users.
